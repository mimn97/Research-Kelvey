# Research-Kelvey

Created and Written by Minhwa Lee 


This is a Python program for implementation of a research by Dr. Robert Kelvey in the Department of Mathematics. 
I was his research assistant during Fall 2019. 

## Works

* Assisted Dr. Robert Kelvey's research on simulation of a game that can be
played on graphs and hypercubes
  * Involves two players tracing out a path on a graph without backtracking or making any loops other than one leading back to the start
  
* Coded and developed a game with Python to test related theories for the project, such as graph theory and game optimization
* Created a Readme file in GitHub about the instruction of how the program for the related game was coded
